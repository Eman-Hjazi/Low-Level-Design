##  In Application Development: The Only Constant is Change

Welcome to software development, where change is not the exception—it’s the rule.

Business needs evolve, user expectations shift, and new features are always around the corner. If your code isn't **designed to handle change**, it will inevitably **break**, **bloat**, or **become unmaintainable**.

So, how do we write code that embraces change rather than fighting it?

By following proven **design principles** that make our software:
* **Flexible** to new requirements.
* **Easy to extend** without modifying existing code.
* **Resilient** to breaking changes.
* A **joy to work with** for future developers.

This is where we explore and apply principles like:

Design Principles :-

* ✅ **SOLID Principles**
* ✅ **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
* ✅ **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

* ✅ [**Encapsulate What Varies**](/DesignPrinciples/DesignPrinciples.md#first-principle--encapsulate-what-varies)
* ✅ [**Program to an Interface, Not an Implementation**](/DesignPrinciples/DesignPrinciples.md#second-principle--program-to-an-interface-not-an-implementation)
* ✅ [**Favor Composition Over Inheritance**](/DesignPrinciples/DesignPrinciples.md#third-and-final-principle-from-head-first-design-patternsfavor-composition-over-inheritance)
